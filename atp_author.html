        <section>
            <p>This website was created based on a research paper from my Fall 2022 
            semester Discrete Mathematics class. It was co-writted by Gabriella Codrington
            and Ethan Ngai. The work for this assignment was evenly distributed between the two members.
            Gabriella was responsible for writing the abstract and introduction, researching the
            second solution, the Boyer-Moore theorem prover and its respective proof, and edit-
            ing the video. Ethan made the presentation and was responsible for doing research
            on G ̈odel’s first incompleteness theorem and its proof. The speaking portions of the
            presentation were also split relatively evenly.
