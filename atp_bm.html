                <section>
                    <p>The Boyer-Moore theorem prover is one of the best-known heuristic theorem provers.
                    It features a powerful heuristic that automatically discovers the induction scheme
                    required for proof. It takes previously proved lemmas and uses them to simplify
                    terms during an attempted proof. It has been used to prove multiple theorems,
                    including the first incompleteness theorem. The motivation for using this theorem
                    prover is to make proofs shorter. So if we have axioms for symbolic computations
                    such as for Lisp computations, the proofs are simplified.</p>
                    <p>The theorem prover does not independently generate the entire proof, rather it is led
                    to the proof via a series of well-thought-out definitions and lemmas that are given
                    by the user of the prover. Therefore, this prover is technically used as a high-level
                    proof checker.</p>
                    <p>In order to prove the first incompleteness theorem, Boyer-Moore uses the syntax and
                    semantics of pure Lisp (a unique language that uses symbolic rather than numeric
                    computation) [6]. The Boyer-Moore logic deals with recursive Lisp functions as long as their evaluations terminate on all arguments. In other words, the functions must
                    be total. The use of solely total functions ensures the simplification of logic and
                    mechanization. Additionally, Boyer-Moore logic is based on first-order logic with
                    equality but without quantifiers. It doesn’t use quantifiers in order to raise the level
                    of mechanization in the theorem prover. Lastly, the logic has no type; the variables
                    range over multiple data structures including booleans, natural numbers, lists, and
                    more.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>The basic axioms are stated in a quantifier-free first-order logic with equality. Two
                    boolean constants “True” and “False” are used (they will be abbreviated as T and
                    F, respectively). The 3-place “IF” function is the only primitive logical operation.
                    For example, the term (IF X Y Z), read as (if X then Y else Z), is axiomatized to
                    return Z if X is equal to F, and Y otherwise as the following:</p>
                    <p>X = F ] (IF X Y Z) = Z</p>
                    <p>X != F ] (IF X Y Z) = Y</p>
                    <p>The Boyer-Moore logic predicate EQUAL can be axiomatized to return T when
                        both arguments and identical, and F if not.</p>
                    <p>X = F ] (EQUAL X Z) = T</p>
                    <p>X != F ] (EQUAL X Z) = F</p>
                    <p>Other Boyer-Moore logical operators include OR, NOT, AND, and IMPLIES. They
                        are defined in terms of IF as the following:</p>
                    <p>(NOT X) = (IF X F T) (if x then false else true)</p>
                    <p>(OR X Y) = (IF X T (IF Y T F)) (if x then true, else if y then true else false)</p>
                    <p>(AND X Y) = (IF X (IF Y T F) F) (if x then, if y then true else false, else false)</p>
                    <p>(IMPLIES X Y) = (IF X (IF Y T F) T) (if x then, if y then true else false, else
                        true)</p>
                </section>

            
                <section>
                    <p>The shell principle of Boyer-Moore allows the user to add axioms that describe
                    new objects. For example, natural numbers are axiomatized by defining a recog-
                    nizer function “NUMBERP,” a constrictor function “ADD1,” a destructor function
                    “SUB1,” and a bottom object “ZERO,” all of which are added in a shell.</p>
                    <p>The total functions accepted by the system have to be defined recursively and the
                    recursion must “bottom out” at some point. The induction principle allows inductive
                    proofs based on these definitions by recursion.</p>
                    <p>The prover uses a formal statement of the incompleteness theorem including a def-
                    inition of the metatheory of Z2 in terms of a Lisp representation for the formulas
                    and proofs of Z2, a hereditarily finite set theory. The theorem asserts the exis-
                    tence of an undecidable sentence U of Z2 such that if U is provable or disprovable
                    in Z2, then it is both provable and disprovable. The completeness of Z2 implies
                    its inconsistency. This is the conventional statement of the incompleteness theo-
                    rem, but such a statement cannot be formalized by the Boyer-Moore prover be-
                    cause the consistency hypothesis requires the use of quantification. The Z2 the-
                    ory is always either incomplete or inconsistent. The undecidable sentence is con-
                    structed by a function that takes “GIVEN” as an argument, so it is represented by
                    the term (UNDECIDABLE-SENTENCE GIVEN). The negation of this is (F-NOT
                    (UNDECIDABLE-SENTENCE GIVEN)). Thus, we can construct an undecidable
                    sentence for any assumption list GIVEN so that any additional undecidable sentence
                    only yields a new undecidable sentence. Therefore, Z2 is essentially incomplete. The
                    incompleteness theorem asserts the existence of a sentence such that if it is either
                    provable or disprovable, it is both provable and disprovable. That sentence is then
                    explicitly constructed in the proof.</p>
                    <p>The representability of the metatheory refers to the non-mechanized proofs of the
                    incompleteness theorem [5]. The Boyer-Moore prover utilizes the Lisp logical oper-
                    ators and the Z2 theory to complete the proof. The steps to the representability
                    theorem include defining a Lisp evaluator, showing that the evaluator can be rep-
                    resented in Z2, and finally, showing that the metatheoretical Lisp functions for Z2
                    can be computed in the evaluator. Finally, the undecidable sentence can be con-
                    structed and the incompleteness theorem can be proved. The steps required to
                    construct the unpredictable sentence include the representation of an enumeration
                    of Z2 proofs, defining a Lisp predicate to search for the first proof of disproof of
                    a formula (also referred to as a theorem checker), and finally, using the fact that
                    the predicate is representable to construct a sentence that states of itself that it is
                    not provable. The undecidable sentence that is constructed is parameterized by the
                    axioms added to the theory. Therefore, the incompleteness proof shows that Z2 is
                    essentially incomplete. It is incomplete because of the addition of finitely many new
                    axioms.
