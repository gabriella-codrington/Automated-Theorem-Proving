                    <h2>What is Automated Theorem Proving?</h2>
                    <p>Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) deals with the development of computer pro-
                    grams that show a statement is a logical consequence of a set of axioms. ATP is
                    about establishing logical consequence with a computer and using it to build proofs
                    for mathematical theorems. The motivation behind using ATP is to make theorem
                    proofs more simple, accurate, and efficient. ATP utilizes first order logic to solve
                    theorems and create proofs. First order logic is a collection of formal systems that
                    uses quantified variable over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences con-
                    taining variables. An example of a theorem prover is the Boyer-Moore prover which
                    created a proof for G ̈odel’s first incompleteness theorem.

                    <h2>Who is Godel and what was his theorem?</h2>
                    <p>Kurt G ̈odel was a 20th-century logician known for the publication of his incom-
                    pleteness theorems in 1931. G ̈odel’s incompleteness theorem was initially assumed
                    to only depend on the logical system that he was working in and therefore the out-
                    come was reliant on that specific system. However, mathematicians would go on
                    to prove that all formals systems have limitations on what can be achieved within
                    them, including programming languages. G ̈odels First Incompleteness Theorem is
                    as follows:
                    </p>
               
                    <p>    
                    ”If there is a consistent mathematical system (i.e., a set of axioms with no contradic-
                    tions) in which you can do a certain amount of arithmetic, then there are statements
                    in the system that are unprovable using only the given system’s axioms” [3].
                    Although there are theorems in G ̈odel’s incompleteness theorems, the first theorem
                    is often referred to as G ̈odel’s incompleteness theorem. Two solutions for G ̈odel’s
                    theorem will be presented in this paper: G ̈odel’s original proof and the Boyer-
                    Moore proof. G ̈odel’s original proof demonstrates that not every statement can
                    be proved via the construction of paradoxical mathematical statements. Boyer-
                    Moore’s proof shows that there are undecidable sentences (statement that is provable
                    and disprovable) via the use of a fixd set of axioms and a formal statement of the
                    incompleteness theorem. Both utilize discrete math topics of logic and set theory.

                    <p>G ̈odels First Incompleteness Theorem is as follows:
                    ”If there is a consistent mathematical system (i.e., a set of axioms with no contradic-
                    tions) in which you can do a certain amount of arithmetic, then there are statements
                    in the system that are unprovable using only the given system’s axioms” [3].
        
                    The first proof for G ̈odel’s first incompleteness theorem is his own proof.
        
                    The second proof for the first incompleteness theorem is one produced by the Boyer-
                    Moore theorem prover.
