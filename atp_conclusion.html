                <p>When G ̈odel first published his incompleteness theorem in 1931, it shocked the
                mathematical community. It had been assumed by the community that math was
                all statements were either provable or unprovable and therefore the world of math
                was considered “complete” [2]. G ̈odel’s theorem transformed the fundamentals of
                mathematics, demonstrating that it did have its limitations and that there were
                true statements that could never be proved. It was initially believed that his proof
                depended on the definite logical system that he worked in and his outcome depended
                on that specific system. However, other mathematicians such as Alan Turing would
                go on to show that the theorem did not depend on the system G ̈odel used [1].</p>
                <p>Since G ̈odel’s incompleteness theorem says that there are true statements that can
                never be proved, the mathematical community will never know with absolute cer-
                tainty whether or not something that is currently believed to be true will one day
                become false. We only believe true statements to be true because they haven’t been
                proven false yet. Furthermore, this theorem threatens the consistency of maths
                since the entirety of math could potentially be inconsistent but we wouldn’t know
                to what extent. We won’t know at what point a contradiction in math might poten-
                tially happen and shatter the world of mathematics rendering it all invalid. If this
                happens one day, what will happen to the world of mathematics?</p>
        
                <p>There are several aspects of the Boyer-Moore prover that makes its proof successful.
                The Lisp-based language of its logic is expressive enough to facilitate direct for-
                mulations of the definition of the first incompleteness theorem. It is sophisticated
                enough to perform low-level and some high-level deductions autonomously via its
                use of heuristics. Users of the prover can direct the prover to check their desired
                proof rather than simply establish that a given assertion is a theorem. The prover
                generates a well-structured description of its attempted proof as an output, making
                it possible to find errors in the formulation and check on the progress of the proof.
                With “break-points,” it is possible to track the application of rewrite rules in a proof.
                Mistakes in the statement of the conjecture are frequently located at these points.</p>

            <p>There are also drawbacks to the prover. The shell principle is rigid and it doesn’t
            allow things such as the addition of a shell corresponding to the well-formed formulas
            of first-order logic. The lack of quantifiers makes the statements of the lemmas
            unnatural from the perspective of mathematicians. For example, the statement of
            the first incompleteness theorem generated by the prover appears different from the
            standard formulation of the theorem. The induction heuristic is not sophisticated enough, therefore the appropriate induction scheme had to be provided by the user as
            a hint to the prover. All of the induction schemes in the proofs of the computability
            of the metatheoretical functions by the Lisp interpreter were supplied as hints. The
            facility used to extend the theorem prover with simplifiers (called metafunctions) was
            too restricted. Therefore, it was not possible to prove the computability of all the
            metatheoretical functions by the Lisp interpreter as a theorem in the metatheory
            of the Boyer-Moore logic. The prover doesn’t allow the use of rewrite rules for
            congruence relations other than the “EQUAL” predicate. The prover is not flexible
            in allowing definitions or theorems to be modified. In order to use the definitions
            and rules, it was frequently necessary to enable and disable functions and rewrite
            rules in the course of the proof. The facility used for providing hints, enabling or
            disabling definitions or lemmas, etc, can be clumsy to use because a user must make
            guesses about the form of the mechanical proof.</p>
       
            <p>Overall, the Boyer-Moore prover’s powerful heuristic system provides convenience
            for solving the trivial first incompleteness theorem, but it is difficult to control the
            system when heuristics fail. This is to be expected because automated reasoning
            provers are still in their infancy. Once the technology is fully developed, these
            provers will be widely regarded and used by mathematicians.</p>
